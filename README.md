## âœ… Project Roadmap

### Week 1: Python Basics
- Learned fundamentals of Python:
  - Variables, data types, loops, functions
  - Conditional statements and I/O operations
- Hands-on practice with simple programs

---

### Week 2: Python Libraries for Data Science
- Explored essential libraries:
  - `NumPy` â€“ for numerical computing
  - `Pandas` â€“ for data manipulation and analysis
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` â€“ for data visualization
  - `Scikit-learn` â€“ for machine learning tools
- Completed assignments involving:
  - Everything learnt from week 1 and week 2.

### Week 3: Introduction to Machine Learning

#### What We Covered:
- **What is Machine Learning?**
- **Basic ML Math** (Linear algebra, statistics, etc.)
- **Terminologies** â€“ features, labels, training/testing data, etc.

#### Supervised Learning
- **Linear Regression**
  - Simple Linear Regression
  - Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
  - Python implementation of both
- **Classification**
  - Logistic Regression (binary classification)
  - Implementation in Python
- **Overfitting**
  - Concept explanation
  - Regularization techniques (L2, train-test split, cross-validation)

#### Unsupervised Learning 
- K-Means Clustering
- K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)

#### ðŸ’» Financial Data with `yfinance`
